# Playlist Sync - Implementation Status

**Status: ✅ IMPLEMENTED**

## Overview
The playlist sync feature has been fully implemented according to the design specification in `base.md`. The implementation includes both delta sync strategies (uploads and playlist membership) with efficient API usage and referential integrity enforcement.

## Key Implementation Details

### Database Schema
- **Playlists** table: PlaylistId (PK), ChannelId (FK), Title, UpdatedAt, LastMembershipSyncAt
- **VideoPlaylists** link table: VideoId + PlaylistId (composite PK) with FK constraints
- **VideoSyncStates** table: ChannelId (PK), LastUploadsCutoff for delta sync tracking
- **Video alternate key**: Added `AK_Videos_VideoId` to enable FK from VideoPlaylists to Videos

### Delta Sync Strategies
1. **Strategy A (Upload Delta)**: Uses `LastUploadsCutoff` to fetch only newer videos from uploads playlist
2. **Strategy B (Playlist Membership)**: Efficient diff-based sync with FK safety enforcement

### API Integration
- Extended `IYouTubeIntegration` with 3 new methods: `GetPlaylistsAsync`, `GetPlaylistVideoIdsAsync`, `GetUploadIdsNewerThanAsync`
- Implemented early-stop cutoff logic matching existing patterns
- Maintains 50-items-per-page batching for API efficiency

### Repository Layer
- **PlaylistRepository**: Full CRUD with membership management and FK safety
- **VideoSyncStateRepository**: Cutoff state management
- Batch operations for performance (500 items for membership inserts)

### Application Services
- **PlaylistSyncService**: Orchestrates both sync strategies with comprehensive logging
- **VideoVisibilityMapper**: Shared utility extracted from VideoService
- Proper exception handling and cancellation support

## Key Features
- ✅ Delta sync minimizes API calls
- ✅ FK safety prevents orphaned playlist memberships  
- ✅ Batch processing for performance
- ✅ Comprehensive logging and metrics
- ✅ Idempotent operations
- ✅ Cancellation token support
- ✅ EF Core migrations applied successfully

## Architecture Compliance
- ✅ All `DateTimeOffset` types with UTC conversions for SQLite
- ✅ Separate files for all public types
- ✅ No abbreviations in variable names  
- ✅ `var` keyword used throughout
- ✅ Dependency injection properly configured
- ✅ Follows existing repository and service patterns

## Next Steps
The feature is ready for:
1. Integration testing with real YouTube API calls
2. Performance testing with large playlists  
3. Scheduled execution via background services
4. API endpoint exposure if needed

## Technical Notes
- The alternate key on `Video.VideoId` enables the many-to-many relationship while preserving the existing composite primary key
- Repository FK enforcement prevents data integrity issues when videos are not yet synced
- Early termination logic in delta sync prevents unnecessary API pagination
